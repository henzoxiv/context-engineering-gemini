# Execute PRP Command

Read the PRP from $ARGUMENTS and implement the feature according to the specifications.

## Process:
1. **Load Context**: Read the entire PRP and understand all requirements
2. **Create Plan**: Break down implementation into concrete, actionable steps
3. **Execute Steps**: Implement each component with proper validation
4. **Run Tests**: Execute all test commands specified in the PRP
5. **Validate**: Ensure all success criteria and acceptance criteria are met
6. **Document**: Update relevant documentation and examples

## Implementation Guidelines:
- Follow the project's established patterns from examples/
- Implement incrementally with validation at each step
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Handle errors gracefully and include appropriate logging
- Follow the coding standards defined in GEMINI.md

## Validation Requirements:
- All unit tests must pass
- Integration tests must pass
- Code must follow project conventions and style guides
- No linting errors allowed
- Documentation must be updated
- Performance requirements must be met

## Iteration Process:
- If any validation fails, analyze the issue and fix it
- Re-run all tests after each fix
- Continue iterating until ALL validation passes
- Don't consider the task complete until every requirement is satisfied

## Success Criteria:
- Feature works as specified in the PRP
- All tests pass (unit, integration, and manual)
- Code quality meets project standards
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- No regressions in existing functionality
