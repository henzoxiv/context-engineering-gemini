# PRP: Multi-Agent Task Orchestration System

## Executive Summary
Build a multi-agent system that can orchestrate complex tasks by coordinating multiple specialized AI agents, each with specific capabilities and tools. The system should handle task decomposition, agent selection, execution coordination, and result aggregation.

## Context
- **Project**: AI Agent orchestration platform
- **Codebase patterns**: Uses async/await patterns, dependency injection, and event-driven architecture
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, Celery, Pydantic
- **Similar implementations**: See examples/agent/ for basic agent patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Functionality
- [ ] Task decomposition engine that breaks complex tasks into subtasks
- [ ] Agent registry system for discovering and managing available agents
- [ ] Orchestration engine that coordinates agent execution
- [ ] Result aggregation system that combines outputs from multiple agents
- [ ] Task execution monitoring with real-time status updates
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed subtasks
- [ ] Agent capability matching for optimal task assignment

### Performance
- [ ] Support concurrent execution of up to 50 agents
- [ ] Task completion time under 30 seconds for standard workflows
- [ ] Memory usage under 512MB for the orchestration system
- [ ] Redis-based caching for agent discovery and task state

### Quality & Reliability
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for all agent interactions
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for unstable agents
- [ ] Graceful degradation when agents are unavailable
- [ ] Transaction rollback for failed multi-step operations

### Security
- [ ] Agent authentication and authorization
- [ ] Input validation for all task parameters
- [ ] Secure communication between agents using TLS

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create base Agent abstract class with standard interface
2. Implement AgentRegistry for agent discovery and management
3. Set up Redis for caching and inter-agent communication
4. Create TaskOrchestrator class with basic coordination logic
5. **Validation**: Unit tests for core classes pass, Redis connectivity confirmed

### Phase 2: Task Decomposition
1. Implement TaskDecomposer that analyzes complex tasks
2. Create task dependency graph representation
3. Add agent capability matching algorithm
4. Implement task priority and scheduling system
5. **Validation**: Task decomposition tests pass, dependency resolution works

### Phase 3: Execution Engine
1. Build async execution engine for parallel agent coordination
2. Implement task state management and persistence
3. Add real-time progress monitoring and status updates
4. Create result aggregation and validation system
5. **Validation**: End-to-end workflow tests pass, performance benchmarks met

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Resilience
1. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
2. Add circuit breaker pattern for unstable agents
3. Create failover and graceful degradation logic
4. Add comprehensive error logging and alerting
5. **Validation**: Fault tolerance tests pass, error recovery verified

## Validation Criteria

### Automated Tests
- [ ] All unit tests pass (`pytest tests/`)
- [ ] Integration tests with Redis pass
- [ ] Load testing with 50 concurrent agents passes
- [ ] Error injection tests pass (`pytest tests/test_error_handling.py`)

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Complex task successfully decomposed and executed
- [ ] Agent failures handled gracefully without system crash
- [ ] Real-time monitoring shows accurate task progress
- [ ] Result aggregation produces correct combined output

### Code Quality
- [ ] No linting errors (`flake8 src/`)
- [ ] Type hints included for all public methods (`mypy src/`)
- [ ] API documentation generated (`sphinx-build docs/`)
- [ ] Code coverage above 85% (`coverage report`)

## Success Metrics
- Task completion success rate > 95% under normal conditions
- System handles agent failures with < 5% task failure rate
- Average task execution time improvement of 40% vs sequential execution
- API response time < 200ms for task submission
- System uptime > 99.9% under normal load

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: Redis becomes a single point of failure
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Implement Redis cluster with failover, add fallback to in-memory coordination

- **Risk 2**: Agent communication overhead reduces performance
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Implement message batching, connection pooling, and async communication

- **Risk 3**: Complex task decomposition produces sub-optimal agent assignment
  - **Probability**: High
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Add machine learning-based optimization, manual override capabilities

## Dependencies & External Resources
- Redis 6.0+ for caching and message queuing
- FastAPI documentation: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
- Celery documentation: https://docs.celeryproject.org/
- SQLAlchemy async patterns: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html

## Confidence Score
**8/10** - High confidence for successful implementation

**Justification**: Well-defined requirements with clear success metrics. Similar patterns exist in examples/ directory. Main risks are around performance optimization and Redis reliability, both of which have proven mitigation strategies.
