# Examples Directory

This directory contains code examples that demonstrate patterns and conventions for this project. The AI assistant will use these examples to understand how to structure and implement new features.

## Structure

- `cli.py` - CLI implementation patterns and argument handling
- `agent/` - Agent architecture and implementation patterns
- `tests/` - Testing patterns and best practices

## Usage

When requesting new features, reference specific examples to help the AI understand:
- Code organization patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Testing strategies
- Documentation styles

Each example is designed to show both what to do and how to do it well.
